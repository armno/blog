Inspired by [`wesbos/uses`](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) repo on GitHub
and [uses.tech](https://uses.tech)
where developers where their
hardware/software/tools they use regularly via the `/uses` page on their blog.

Here are my tools, updated for 2021-2022.

## Software

### Coding

- [VSCode Insider](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) as my primary code editor (I code HTML/JS/CSS primarily).
I prefer the Insider build instead of the stable build because I like to get more frequent updates.
Extensions I use (but not limited to) are:
  - [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim)
  - [Angular Language Service](https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service)
  - [EditorConfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)
  - [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)
  - [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode)
  - [IntelliCode](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/intellicode)
  - [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for a quick editing from the terminal
  - Here is my [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc).
  - [ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim) color scheme
- [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/version3.html) with
  - [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with my modified version of [cloud](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles/blob/master/cloud-armno.zsh-theme) theme
  - [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell)
  - [dotfiles ](https://github.com/armno/dotfiles)
- [JetBrains Mono fonts](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) in both code editors and terminal.
- Terminal colors: I have both dark and light themes set up and use depending on the light conditions. I create `dark` and `light` shell commands to switch between base16 themes.
  - dark: `base16_material-darker`
  - light: `base16_google-light`

  - light: [`Ayu Light`](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu)
