<p class="lead">
  My name is Armno. I am a Frontend Developer at <a href="https://buzzwoo.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BUZZWOO!</a>.
</p>

I primarily work on web frontend stuffs: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
My primary focus is currently on JavaScript and Angular Framework.
I also enjoy digging into frontend performance and web animations.

Beside web development, I am also into books, photography, [building mechanical keyboards](https://armno.in.th/2017/08/20/building-custom-mechanical-keyboard/) and [road bike cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3637623).
